/**
 * Rebuilding a resumed submission's file list.
 *
 * `uploadReportFilesDirectToR2` derives each manifest entry's `fileId` from its
 * position in the submitted array (`images-0`, `images-1`, `videos-7`, ...) and
 * the backend keys its stored R2 objects by those ids. A resumed upload must
 * therefore reproduce the identical array, in the identical order, or it would
 * present a different manifest under a submission id the server already holds
 * photographs for — which is what SUBMISSION_MANIFEST_CHANGED rejects.
 *
 * The two report types do *not* assemble that array the same way, and the
 * difference is load-bearing:
 *
 *   Asset       every main and report-only photo first, then all videos, with
 *               one flat running imageIndex.
 *   Lot Listing each lot's main photos, then its report-only photos, then its
 *               videos, before moving to the next lot — so a video can sit at
 *               array position 3 and be `videos-3`, not `videos-0` — and with
 *               lotIndex plus an imageIndex counted within its own bucket.
 *
 * Both orderings live here so the submitting service and the resume path share
 * one definition rather than drifting.
